# Beer Game
The beer game is an online game intended for students to better understand how supply chain works in a real world situation, applying the theory learned in class and practicing decision making. Therefore it is a functional type of game. This project simulates the way beer is being ordered and delivered from production and factory,going to distributor, then wholesaler and then to retailer and consumer. Each of these stages can be played by the students who, order enough beer stock in the position they hold, taking into consideration shipment times, delays, backorders, inventory such that,every partner in this chain doesnâ€™t suffer any losses.The objective of the game is to satisfy the demand of the customer, while keepingthe cost low. There is a cost for holding inventory and a cost for not satisfying demand(backorder). The demand for the product remains until it is satisfied i.e. backorder persists until it is fulfilled. It creates the illusion of a real time supply chain, each couldview only the downstream data and the upstream shipment they receive.
